	<h1>Hannah Lee Farmer</h1>
		<p>I am a Search Engine Marketing Manager interested in working with brands to demonstrate how paid search campaigns are a crucial and highly effective part of an integrated marketing strategy. I have experience delivering results for a variety of clients, including: retailers, health and beauty brands, pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations.

		When I'm not working, I enjoy running or playing intramural volleyball, planning my next big (or small) travel adventure, and hosting people in my apartment for dinner and drinks.</p>
