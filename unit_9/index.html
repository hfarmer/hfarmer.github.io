  <p class="activitytitle">New Years Eve: Back Room</p>
  <p class="activity">I began 2016 the best way I know how, with some of my closest NYC friends. We dined on my favorite takeout pizza (Posto's Parma) in a friend's East Village apartment before attending a party at Backroom in LES. We drank champagne out of teacups in this tucked-away speakeasy and frolicked into the early morning hours of the brand new 2016.</p>

  <p class="activitytitle"> Company Retreat: Playa del Carmen </p>
  <p class="activity"> When you are fortunate enough to work for one of New York's Top 100 Places to Work, you are also fortunate enough to take an incredible retreat to Mexico. My coworkers and I prevailed 6 hours of delays and 2 broken airplanes to arrive in paradise. Over the course of 5 days, we bonded professionally and personally by celebrating our successes and learning from each other's experiences and paths to Good Apple. When we arrived back home in New York, the Fitbit challenge began! </p>

  <p class="activitytitle"> Personal Holiday: Prospect Park and Brooklyn Museum</p>
  <p class="activity"> Exploring all that New York City has to offer is a nearly impossible task, especially when you add work, sleep, and social engagements to the mix. However, on Friday, January 29th, I turned one of my hard earned vacation days into a "Hannah Holiday," a day purposefully set aside for exploring uncharted territory (and subsequently, racking up a record day of steps). I hopped on the subway to Brooklyn, quickly visited the Brooklyn Library, strolled through Prospect Park, sipped on some coffee while reading in Tugboat Tea Company, and then met a friend to tour the Brooklyn Museum. While Prospect Park was incredible, and I want to go again in the warmer months, the museum was the true star of the show. Two highlights were: Stephen Powers: Coney Island is Still A Dreamland (To a Seagull) and The Dinner Party by Judy Chicago. Hannah Holiday? Check.</p>
